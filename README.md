## Overview

GoldenScalp MT4 is an expert advisor designed for gold trading. It uses a combination of technical indicators and risk management techniques to identify profitable trading opportunities. The algorithm calculates the lot size and stop loss based on the current account balance and market volatility.

## Input Parameters

- `lotSize`: Trading lot size. Default value is 0.01.
- `balanceUnits`: Balance units for lot calculation. Default value is 100.
- `preset`: Preset options for the algorithm. Default value is 'GS default SL 001for100'.

## Global Variables

- `stopLoss`: Hidden stop loss for the trades.
- `accountBalance`: Current account balance.
- `maxExposure`: Maximum exposure allowed.
- `drawdown`: Current drawdown.

## Trading Function

The `tradeGold()` function is responsible for executing the trading logic. It retrieves the current account balance, calculates the lot size based on the balance units, and calculates the hidden stop loss based on market volatility. The actual trading logic should be implemented within this function.

## Volatility Calculation

The `calculateVolatility()` function calculates the market volatility based on prior hours. The specific logic for volatility calculation should be implemented within this function.

## Main Program Loop

The `OnTick()` function is the main program loop. It calls the `tradeGold()` function to execute the trading logic. It also includes sections for risk management, real-time data analysis, user-friendly interface, error handling, logging, backtesting, and compatibility with different brokers and platforms. These sections should be implemented according to the specific requirements and strategies.

## Program Initialization

The `OnInit()` function initializes the program. It sets the initial account balance, maximum exposure, drawdown, and preset options. The default preset option is 'GS default SL 001for100', but custom preset options can also be implemented.

## Program Termination

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the program is terminated. It performs necessary cleanup and post-delivery support tasks.

Note: This code is provided as a sample and may require modifications and additions to fully implement the GoldenScalp MT4 trading algorithm. For the official developer and complete documentation, please refer to MQL5 website.
